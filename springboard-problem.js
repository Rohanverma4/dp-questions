// The floor of 91 springboard is covered by h Ã— w square tiles, where there are h rows of tiles from front (first row) to back (last row) and w columns of tiles from left to right. Each tile has value of 1 to 100 written on it.
// You have to walk on tiles such that sum of numbers is as high as possible, subject to the following restrictions:
// You start by choosing any tile in the first row, and collects the value on that tile. Then, you move to a tile in the next row, collects the value on the tile, and so on until you reach the last row.
// When you move from one tile to a tile in the next row, you can only move to the tile just below it or diagonally to the left or right.
// Given the values of h and w, and the value on each tile, write a program to compute the maximum possible sum you can grab in one single trip from the first row to the last row.
